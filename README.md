In this example we have created a simple form with various input fields and buttons to collect user
information such as first name, last name, email ID etc., We also added checkboxes for selecting
interests in different categories like Computer Science, Sports or Music. The submit button will display all
the entered data on screen using `JOptionPane`. Additionally there's another button named Reset which clears out any
the entered details on screen using `JOptionPane`. Additionally there's another button named Reset which clears out any
the entered details on clicking it while Reset Button clears out any previous data that was filled by the user
the entered details on clicking it while Reset Button clears out any previously filled data from textfields.
Note that you can customize your own layout of UI components according to your requirements using Java's
Swing library. You may use other types of controls depending upon what kind of inputs are required by users
in your application. Good luck! -->
